<!-- Additional Information -->
<div class="addtionalinformationdriftaway">
 <p class="addinfodriftaway"> About Drift Away </p> 
</div>

 <p class="b-i">Drift Away is a platform based game. The aim of the game is to jump across clouds collecting stars and avoiding the sprites otherwise known as Nightmares. There are three stars per level and three levels. There is a star counter so the player knows how many they have collected overall. This determines how well the player did, regardless of whether they completed the game or not.</p>
